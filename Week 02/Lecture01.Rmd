My First R Markdown File
========================

This is my first R markdown file.  

Here, we're going load some data.  

```{r}
library(datasets)
data(airquality)
summary(airquality)
```

Let's first make a pairs plot of the data.

```{r}
pairs(airquality)
```

Here's a regression model of ozone on wind, solar radiation and temperature.

```{r}
library(stats)
fit <- lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Solar.R + Temp, data = airquality)
summary(fit)
```

Here's an unordered list:

* First element

* Second element
